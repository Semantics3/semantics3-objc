# semantics3
semantics3-objc is a objective-C client for accessing the Semantics3 Products API, which provides structured information, including pricing histories, for a large number of products.
See https://www.semantics3.com for more information.

Quickstart guide: https://www.semantics3.com/quickstart
API documentation can be found at https://www.semantics3.com/docs/

## Installation
To install the latest source from the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/siddharthan64/semantics3-objc.git

```

#Third party libraries added:
OAuthConsumer

## Adding the static library to your project
1. Create builds for i386 (simulator) and armv7 (iphone/ipad)
2. Change target to universal library and build the program to create a static library file that is compatible with both the architecture.

This creates a separate folder for the universal library as shown below:

## Settings for the Project Using the Static Library
Add the static library as a framework under Build Phases > Link Binary With Libraries and add the libsemantics3-objc.a file.
Next make sure project is set to search for User Search Paths. This is done under Build Settings > Always Search User Paths and make sure its set to YES.
In the same area find User Header Search Paths and add:

```bash
"$(PROJECT_TEMP_DIR)/../UninstalledProducts/include"

```
This tells Xcode to look for static libraries within the intermediate build folder that Xcode creates during the build process. In here, we have the "include" folder we are using for our static library locations we setup in step 2 for the static library project settings. This is the most important step in getting Xcode to correctly find your static libraries.

## Configure the Workspace
Here we want to configure the workspace so that it will build the static library when we build our app. This is done by editing the scheme used for our app.

Make sure you have the scheme selected that will create your application.
From the scheme drop-down, choose Edit Scheme.
Select Build at the top of list on the left. Add a new target by pressing the + on the middle pane.
You should see the static library show up for the library you are trying to link. Choose the iOS static library.
Click both Run and Archive. This tells the scheme to compile the libraries for the static library whenever you build your app.
Drag the static library above your application target. This makes the static libraries compile before your application target.

## Getting Started

In order to use the client, you must have both an API key and an API secret. To obtain your key and secret, you need to first create an account at
https://www.semantics3.com/
You can access your API access credentials from the user dashboard at https://www.semantics3.com/dashboard/applications
 
Add the value -ObjC to the application target's other linker flags under 'build settings'
  
### Using the static library:

 The data can be crunched by using the following objects:
 
 1.semantics3_objc
 2.Products
 3.Offers
 4.Categories
 
 

## Examples

The following examples show you how to interface with some of the core functionality of the Semantics3 Products API. For more detailed examples check out the Quickstart guide: https://www.semantics3.com/quickstart


     semantics3_objc *sem = [[semantics3_objc alloc] initSemantic3Request:OAUTH_KEY withapiSecret:OAUTH_SECRET andEndpoints:@"products"];

     NSMutableDictionary *tempDict = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
    
     [tempDict setObject:@"4znupRCkN6w2Q4Ke4s6sUC" forKey:@"sem3_id"];
     [tempDict setObject:@"Satellite" forKey:@"mod"];
     
    [sem field:tempDict];
    [sem runQuery];
    
The output is received using the delegate method as shown below:

    -(void)queryData:(NSString *)content{
        NSLog(@"query output: %@",content);
     }

### Building your queries
A query can be constructed by three ways:
   
1. Passing a NSMutableDictionary Object directly to the field:(id)queryObject method
    
2. Passing a JSON string directly to the field:(id)queryObject method
    
3. Constructing a query using the -(void)buildQuery:(id)object andKeys:(NSString *)keys; method.
    
    
### Nested Search Query

You can intuitively construct all your complex queries but just repeatedly using the following method:
                     
          -(void)buildQuery:(id)object andKeys:(NSString *)keys;
          
Here is a sample complex nested query:

     q={"cat_id":4992,"brand":"Toshiba","weight":{"gte":1000000,"lt":5000000},"sitedetails":{"name":"frys.com <http://frys.com>","latestoffers":{"currency":"USD","price":{"gte":100}}},"sort":{"name":"dsc"},"offset":10,"limit":5}

The above complex query can be constructed using the query builder method as below:
      
      semantics3_objc *sem = [[semantics3_objc alloc] initSemantic3Request:OAUTH_KEY withapiSecret:OAUTH_SECRET andEndpoints:@"products"];
 
       [sem buildQuery:@"4992" andKeys:@"cat_id"];
       [sem buildQuery:@"Toshiba"andKeys:@"brand"];
       [sem buildQuery:@"1000000" andKeys:@"weight,gte"];
       [sem buildQuery:@"5000000" andKeys:@"weight,lt"];
       [sem buildQuery:@"frys.com <http://frys.com>"andKeys:@"sitedetails,name" ];
       [sem buildQuery:@"USD" andKeys:@"sitedetails,latestoffers,currency"];
       [sem buildQuery:@"100" andKeys:@"sitedetails,latestoffers,price,gte"];
       [sem buildQuery:@"dsc" andKeys:@"sort,name"];
       [sem buildQuery:@"10" andKeys:@"offset"];
       [sem buildQuery:@"5" andKeys:@"limit"];
